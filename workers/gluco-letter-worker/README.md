# Gluco Letter Worker Prototype

This is the first Cloudflare Worker prototype for GlucoScope AI Letter.

It does **not** call OpenAI yet.  
It returns a fixed gentle gluco test letter from the summarized payload.

## Local dev

```bash
cd workers/gluco-letter-worker
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open GlucoScope with:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:5500/index.html?debugAiWorker=1#live
```

The frontend will call:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8787/api/gluco-letter
```

## Safety notes

- No OpenAI API key is used in this prototype.
- No raw Nightscout logs are expected.
- The request should contain summarized glucose data only.
- Turnstile, cache, usage counters, and budget guard are future phases.
